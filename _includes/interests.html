							<b>High Performance Computing</b>. I have extensive professional knowledge with multithreading, parallelization and SIMD and even if I'm not active in the field nowadays I still make experiments with SIMD optimizations and parallel programs with OpenMP and CUDA in my spare time. I follow the HPC news and I'm really excited about the EuroHPC programme of building petascale and exascale supercomputers across Europe that could be leveraged for scientific and technological advancements.

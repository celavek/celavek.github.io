					I am a software engineer with more than 18 years of experience and an innovative problem solver
					passionate about leveraging technology for transformative solutions. With a diverse background in
					software development, in different domains and environments, in both individual contributor and tech
					leadership roles, I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my expertise to drive impactful
					outcomes. I am committed to continuous learning and driven by a curiosity for emerging trends, I
					possess a strong track record of delivering results. I like to work aside team members from whom I
					can learn in order to improve my skills and to whom I can share my knowledge in a deep spirit of
					collaboration.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love tackling hard problems that have customer impact, delivering high quality solutions. I'm
					looking for a senior individual contributor / leadership role where I can take on technical
					leadership responsibility, and leverage my experience building backend applications, microservices
					and distributed systems at scale.

							In April 2023 I have joined Powerdale as their Software Development Lead in order to
							architect the migration to the cloud of their EV Mobility Platform <a
								href="https://www.powerdale.com/en/product/nexxtmove">Nexxtmove</a>. I am also managing
							a small team of software engineers scaling it both at human level and in terms of software
							development practices.
							These are exciting times for electric vehicles and electro-mobility and I'm really happy to
							be able to bring my contribution to that and to a greener future in transportation.
						</p>

							Since September 2021 until April 2023, while at Amazon, I worked first in the retail
							organization to expand Amazon in new marketplaces and geographies and helped with the launch
							of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com.be/">amazon.com.be</a> marketplace in Belgium. Then I
							joined AWS to work on the future of authorization services - in that role I helped my team
							on their path to launch a new AWS service - <a
								href="https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions/">Amazon Verified Permissions </a>.
						</p>

							While working for SWIFT, for which I started in June 2019, I have developed features
							for the Alliance Gateway array of products and I've had an extremely important contribution
							in
							the process that led my squad adopting proper Agile methodologies practices and that enabled
							my teammates to work effectively in the context of SWIFT's Agile transformation.
						</p>

							In my previous job at Sony Depthsensing Solutions(f.k.a. SoftKinetic), for which I worked
							between July 2010 and February 2019, I have led and been instrumental in porting and
							optimizing
							the 3D sensors drivers and libraries to run on ARM platforms, paving the way for the
							company's software products to be used inside embedded devices, phones and cars. As part of
							that effort I have designed and implemented a cross-platform SIMD(Single Instruction
							Multiple Data) library for low level code optimizations that is still used today as the
							basis for optimizations across all of Sony Depthsensing Solutions' drivers and middleware.
						</p>
						<p>
							That allowed me to easily support within my organization multiple processor architectures in
							terms of software optimizations. It reduced development and maintenance time and freed
							engineering resources. The library helped all the teams in the software department achieve
							quicker and better the targets in terms of performance. It helped my colleagues write better
							optimized code, allowing them to think more on the algorithmic part of the process rather
							than on the intricacies and details of the target platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was the technical lead regarding porting, optimization and multithreading aspects of
							the Human Tracking Library, a library for multi-user 3D full-body tracking using a depth
							camera sensor, for the PlayStation 4 console. I designed and implemented the pipelining
							system of the library in order to achieve optimal performance on the PlayStation 4's
							hardware.
							With that architecture in place and the optimizations that it enabled, my team achieved the
							contractual targets in terms of performance. It was the beginning of the collaboration with
							Sony, which eventually led to the acquisition by Sony Semiconductor.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have led the development of the low level driver and the optimization efforts for the user
							space driver for a rooftop 3D camera system used in BMW's 2015 series 7 car, which proved
							to be the start of a very fruitful collaboration concretized with the further development of
							the system for other BMW models.
						</p>

						<p>
							I have also worked on machine learning related libraries and classifier models used for
							in-cabin gesture recognition and monitoring inside cars, and designed, configured and
							administered a small cluster solution to run machine learning related task loads. The usage
							of the cluster reduced the processing time for the model training and parameter tuning from
							72 hours to just 8 hours making the model development process much more streamlined and
							effective.
						</p>
					<li>
						<p>
							At Freescale(currently NXP), between March 2006 and June 2010, I worked on the CodeWarrior
							IDE(of Metrowerks fame), developing debuggers and profilers for DSPs and various ARM
							architecture based processors that Freescale had in its portfolio. As part of that I helped
							my team deliver successfully through three major product release cycles.
						</p>
					<li>
						<p>
							At Continental, between November 2004 and February 2006, I developed features related to the
							ABS(Antilock Brake System) car specific ECUs(Electronic Control Units) that the company was
							developing at that time.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							I have extensive knowledge and experience with the C++ programming language, Iâ€™m fluent
							in C, Python, Golang, Java, Rust and Assembly Language.
							I have knowledge of multiple CPU architectures and experience that spans from working at
							the lowest level of abstraction - that is close to the CPU using machine code - to the
							higher level of abstractions - that is software components, frameworks, systems and their
							interactions.
